your right is to work but not its fruits

thanks for doing the scent thing Saturday! it was a lot of fun. I've been thinking today about qualia vs. desire and desire is bad

discipline, stoicism, buddhism, hinduism. the realms! how beautiful!

do you need to form negative impressiosn about things to function effectively?
