my friend once told me a story along the lines of:
they hada friend who played starcraft. Most starcraft players have insane words per minute. Not this friend! this friend was only like 40 apm, which was kinda low, and also still top 2%. 



the point my friend was trying to make at the time was that I was task switching a lot so my apm was high but the net outcomes of that were really bad. 

in general, I see a lot of people trying to increase hours they work or stuff like that. this seems silly. if you want to do really cool things, the nit seems like you should be trying to do high leverage while having low arm to maximize your impact. 



what skills make your APM higher? how do you make each individual action better?
