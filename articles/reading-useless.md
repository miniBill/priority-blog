most reading seems not useful by default. usefulness of reading to me is just: how do your moments of reading reverberate over time? Will it change what you're doing 10 years from now? 

(I will take for granted that reader agrees that most reading is not remembered and thus is not useful)

some solutions

- spaced repetition cards
- hammertime style exercises
- inner simulator
