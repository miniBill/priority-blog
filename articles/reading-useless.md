most reading seems not useful by default. usefulness of reading to me is just: how do your moments of reading reverberate over time? Will it change what you're doing 10 years from now? 

(I will take for granted that reader agrees that most reading is not remembered and thus is not useful)

some solutions

- spaced repetition cards
- hammertime style exercises
- inner simulator

find old cmap thing

IMO, most “soft skills” books are not trying to add explicit statements to your store of “trusted explicit/verbal statements”. 

Instead, they are trying to [...]to try out in your inner simulator

—bits that you can then keep, or not, according to whether they feel promising when you imagine trying them out. Later, you can try the promising bits out in the actual world.

soft skills book lead to REM style internal experiments.
