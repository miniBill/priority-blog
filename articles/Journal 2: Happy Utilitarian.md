I feel pretty happy this morning. I like it a lot. It feels easy to just write and learn. I wish all my mornings were like this. I'm going to try:

Consciously see what you see when you feel good, hear what you hear, notice the body sensation. Then, to start, imagine each one of them. When you feel good, rev it up by making it bigger and brighter and louder and more intense. Send the feeling through your whole body, then let it leave (it will want to leave from a specific place, just like the feeling will want to start in a particular space... as the feeling *leaves* (say through your toes) circle it around and let it come in again where it started.

(Even though, rereading it just now, I realize I rarely do much more than just *recalling* that happy feeling; the circling stuff around I've usually skipped.)

What do I feel right now?

I think the biggest thing is that I feel hopeful. A few days ago, I was frustrated because there's so much in my life I want to figure out but it's a tangeld mess. That feels like an opportunity. Over they years, much learning has felt less interesting to me because my expectancy dropped. My expectancy feels higher for learning right now because hope raises all my expectancy. Epistemologically, this seems great! There's so much to learn and apply and improve with. There are things I'm struggling to reason with but who cares! The best I can do is definitionally the best I can do; no need to worry about anything beyond that. 

I want to keep this. I want to be always hopeful. I want to do things and feel like they're worth doing. I want to be able to enjoy processes. 

I also feel some amount of love for something but love has a large semantic space and I don't know how I'd define it. I was at a party 2 nights ago. I like asking people about themselves. I found sometimes though that it was hard to continue some conversations and that I got a bit bored. Thinking back, that feels crazy! There are so many more questions I could've asked these people. What was your childhood like? What do you think is the coolest project you aren't working on? What do you want your life to be like? Who do you think is the person in the world you love the most? Who's the person who's positively influenced your life the most? There's so much complexity inside people. 

There's some sort of internal vibe that's also bouncing around. Something that reminds me of my childhod and a little bit of when I was in France, though mildly. There's a feeling I've been able to tell I used to have more when I was a kid, that there was a future ahead of me and that I didn't need to hurry so hard. I'm not sure what I feel about hurrying but I think the feeling of hope and potential I had more of as a child was really nice. 

The world owes me nothing.
