Read a great thread by visa, he said he was bad at delivering and felt bad. 

This has happened to me a lot. I generally feel really bad about mistakes and i think this is largely because i want to signal to others that i really feel bad and am sorry. this is a not effective strategy. 

i realized after tweet though that stress is a form of accountability: it forces me to do the things I really feel are right. It's on my side! I can't really get rid of it without being able to either act in the ways I want or just not do things that'll lead to stress
